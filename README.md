A shitty game test...

## Introduction
My friend and me once had fun and started making a silly game. This day, the game developed step by step.
At home, I tried stuff with Networking, see the Networking branch (This also includes Discord-RPC, will see 
if I reimplement this, but without function). And now we're a lot deeper in development than we originally thought.
Well, it's still a shitty game.

## Gameplay
This game is what I would call a Combat-Platformer. Jump around and kill your enemy. Sounds fun? I don't know... 
You can die by falling to fast or to deep, flying to high or to fast against ceilings. Over time your knockback increases.
You can reduce it by collecting Thangs. I recently did the step to make life easier for us to create characters so the next 
things will be character related.

## Resume
Why did you even read this?
